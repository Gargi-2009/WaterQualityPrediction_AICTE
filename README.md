# **Water-Quality-Prediction-AICTE**
This is my machine learning project developed as part of the AICTE Virtual Internship in collaboration with Edunet Foundation, sponsored by Shell, during June 2025. The goal of the project is to predict multiple water quality parameters to support early detection of water pollution and improve environmental monitoring.

## **Project Overview**
Access to clean water is a global priority. Accurate and timely prediction of key water quality indicators can help protect communities and ecosystems by enabling quick action.

In this project, I:  
- Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets  
- Built a multi-target regression pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor  
- Evaluated model performance using relevant regression metrics  
- Added a classification feature to label water samples as Safe or Unsafe based on threshold criteria  
- Enhanced visualization by adding a Safe/Unsafe column with green and red color codes  
- Created a pie chart to visualize proportions of safe vs unsafe water samples  
- Designed a bar chart to compare the counts of safe and unsafe samples

## **Technologies Used**
- Python 3.12  
- Pandas, NumPy (data handling)  
- Scikit-learn (model building & evaluation)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook (experimentation and documentation)

## **Predicted Water Quality Parameters**
The model predicts multiple parameters, including:
- NH4 (Ammonium)  
- BOD5 (BSK5)  
- O2 (Dissolved Oxygen)  
- NO3 (Nitrate)  
- NO2 (Nitrite)  
- SO4 (Sulfate)  
- PO4 (Phosphate)  
- CL (Chloride)

## **Model Performance**
I evaluated the model using:
- RÂ² Score  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
